# PasswordStrengthMeter

This application is designed to test the strength of passwords. It provides a field for entering a
password, and below the field, there are three sections that indicate the strength of the password.
The strength of the password is determined based on specific criteria, and the sections change color
accordingly.

In addition to the strength sections, there are also helpful hints provided in the form of a list.
These hints indicate specific requirements for the password.

## Password Strength Criteria

The password strength is determined using the following criteria:

- Only letters, digits, or symbols: The password is considered easy.
- Combination of letters-symbols, letters-digits, or digits-symbols: The password is considered
  medium.
- Contains letters, symbols, and numbers: The password is considered strong.

## Features

1. Real-time password strength assessment: The application provides instant feedback on the strength
   of the entered password, updating the strength sections and color indicators in real time as the
   password is being typed.
2. Password validation hints: In addition to the strength indicators, the application also provides
   helpful hints in the form of a list. These hints specify the specific requirements for a strong
   password, such as minimum length, inclusion of letters, numbers, and symbols.

3. Responsive design: The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices,
   ensuring a seamless user experience on desktop and mobile platforms.
